# Marlowe Transition details

Reflecting on Marlowe's growing community momentum, IOG is supporting Marlowe’s transition to a community-maintained stewardship model. During this transition phase, IOG will only be doing critical maintenance and bug-fixing work and will undertake no further direct development. The following arrangements are therefore being put in place:

- **New repository and transfer**: Marlowe repositories will be transferred to an independent, not-for-profit community organization. Follow the latest advancements in a new Marlowe Lang Github Organization https://github.com/marlowe-lang.
- **Transitional funding and support**: Active development will no longer be supported by IOG, marking a shift to a community-maintained approach. IOG will provide interim resources to facilitate any essential bug fixes throughout 2024 and fund the Marlowe infrastructure in the TxPipe Demeter environment until the end of the year. 
- **Marlowe 2025 / Catalyst 12 Fund**: To further support Marlowe’s roadmap in 2025, members of the original Marlowe team have submitted a Catalyst proposal, introducing a Marlowe DApp Starter Kit and upgrades, such as validator enhancements, runtime fee mechanism and oracle protocol. Read more here: [Marlowe 2025 Catalyst Proposal](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/122392) 
- **Marlowe Transition Team**: The Marlowe Transition Team, comprising Nicolas Henin, Tomasz Rybarczyk, and Simon Thompson (who will leave IOG at the end of June), are spearheading this initiative. They aim to secure additional support through a Catalyst Fund application to Fund 12, transitioning to work full-time on Marlowe independently of IOG.
- **Marlowe Special Interest Group (SIG)**: An independent Marlowe Special Interest Group will be established to serve as a focal point for developers, users, and stakeholders. Initial discussions are set to take place in the `marlowe-sig` Discord channel, to the stewardship of a non-profit and community-maintained organization. See more details about [how to join SIG](./sig-charter.md)

These changes are expected to be in place by the end of July 2024, aligning with the potential Catalyst funding.
