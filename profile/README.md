Marlowe is a robust, open-source technology that provides a special purpose language describing asset flows on blockchain. As a special purpose, domain-specific language (DSL) it offers a higher-level model of contracts than other Cardnao languages, albeit in a more restricted domain. This means that we can provide safety guarantees, such as no assets being held in a script indefinitely, simply by the design of the language, and others, such as tools to fully analyze for contract faults before running a contract. 

Marlowe core technology has been audited, and it supports contracts on mainnet as well as in pre-production; its Runtime enables all the necessary on- and off-chain contract activity, including the tedious work of transaction construction; and the TypeScript SDK supports Marlowe as a component within a complete DApp. It is thus a smart contract technology that is complementary to Aiken, PlutusTx or Scalus, and abstracts away from the complexities of Cardano and provides a local, account-based model like Ethereum.
