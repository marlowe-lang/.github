Marlowe is a robust, open-source technology that provides a special purpose language describing asset flows on blockchain. As a special purpose, domain-specific language (DSL) it offers a higher-level model of contracts than other Cardnao languages, albeit in a more restricted domain. This means that we can provide safety guarantees, such as no assets being held in a script indefinitely, simply by the design of the language, and others, such as tools to fully analyze for contract faults before running a contract. 

Marlowe core technology has been audited, and it supports contracts on mainnet as well as in pre-production; its Runtime enables all the necessary on- and off-chain contract activity, including the tedious work of transaction construction; and the TypeScript SDK supports Marlowe as a component within a complete DApp. It is thus a smart contract technology that is complementary to Aiken, PlutusTx or Scalus, and abstracts away from the complexities of Cardano and provides a local, account-based model like Ethereum.

### The Marlowe Language Community Interest Company

Marlowe is a fully open-source, community maintained project under the auspices of the Marlowe Language CIC (Community Interest Company), a uk-based non-profit organisation. The CIC is very grateful to IOG for supporting this transition process to independence. For more details see [this blog post](https://marlowe.iohk.io/blog/the-past-present-and-future-of-marlowe-a-journey-of-innovation-and-community-empowerment). To coordinate community activity and interest, the CIC runs the Marlowe Special Interest Group, which is currently meeting [here](https://discord.com/channels/826816523368005654/1239607206446497843). 

Marlowe has received support from Catalyst Fund 13 to develop and implement [a novel Marlowe Oracle protocol](https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1300131/milestones/3).
A longer overview of the status and plans for Marlowe can be found [here](https://github.com/marlowe-lang/.github/blob/main/Marlowe%20-Status-Report-Oct-2024.md).

The Marlowe repositories originally hosted by IOG are now hosted by this independent GitHub organization, and as part of this transition, we are moving also our infrastructure, here are the new URLs :
